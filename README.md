# Honeypot-Based Vehicular Attack Detection

![Tests](https://github.com/AnasHaroun/attackRate_for_attack_prediction/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This repository provides a modular machine learning pipeline for detecting attacks in vehicular networks using behavioral data and honeypot analysis. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, trust analysis, model training, and test automation.
